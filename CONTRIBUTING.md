# Contributing

**Here's how you can help.**

## Process

We use Pull Requests to develop conversations around ideas, and turn ideas into actions.

### Pull Request Basics

1. Anyone can submit a Pull Request with changes they'd like to see made.
2. Pull Requests should attempt to solve a single, clearly defined problem.
3. Everyone should submit Pull Requests early, so everyone on the team is aware of the direction you are taking.
4. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before submitting the Pull Request.
5. Update the `changelog.md` with details of changes. Our changelog contains changes by month.
6. Modern Tribe will review and address pull requests based on our business needs.

## Coding Conventions

* JS: Use our linting rules
* PostCSS: Use our linting rules
